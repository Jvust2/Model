# Model

Drive-first local AI website.

Google Drive is the canonical model vault. The website discovers model packages with Google Drive API, while the local Windows Runtime downloads selected models directly from Drive API into a local cache and runs them on the current computer.

**Google Drive for desktop is not required.**

## Default chat bootstrap

The Runtime chat path is already implemented, but the canonical Drive vault may still have no actual chat GGUF. In that state the model library shows **准备默认聊天模型** instead of pretending a registry-only model is runnable.

The Drive artifact:

    AI-Model-Vault/notebook_launchers/启动_Qwen3-0.6B_Q8_0_DriveFirst.ipynb

prepares the official **Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0** GGUF as a small end-to-end validation model. It writes to:

    AI-Model-Vault/llm/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF/Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf

The notebook verifies the official SHA256 and the fixed GGUF header before writing `MODEL_READY.json`. After it completes, rescan the vault; the website can recognize an unregistered GGUF inside an explicit chat category and expose the normal llama.cpp **使用模型** action.

This bootstrap model is for validating the local chat pipeline. It does not replace the larger registered Qwen / DeepSeek / Coder / writing models.

See `docs/DEFAULT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP.md` for the exact invariant and verification flow.

## One-time Windows install

For normal use, open the [Runtime package workflow](https://github.com/Jvust/Model/actions/workflows/runtime-package-drive-api.yml), choose the latest successful run on `main`, download its `Model-Web-Runtime-…` artifact, extract it, then run:

    runtime\Install.cmd

The source repository does not contain `ModelRuntime.exe`; use the workflow artifact above, which includes the compiled executable. The packaged installer does **not** require a system Python installation.

The installer:

- uses the bundled standalone `ModelRuntime.exe`;
- asks for `llama-server.exe` only when it cannot find one automatically;
- copies the Runtime to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JvustModel\app`;
- enables current-user Windows auto-start;
- starts a tray Runtime in the background;
- opens the Model website.

After that, normal use is simply:

    open https://jvust.github.io/Model/

The website automatically reconnects to the local Runtime. You do not need to run `Model.cmd` every time.

To remove the background Runtime:

    runtime\Uninstall.cmd

Use `runtime\Model.cmd` only as a manual/debug launcher.

Default model cache:

    D:\Model

You can override it with `MODEL_CACHE_ROOT` or `runtime\start_bridge.ps1 -CacheRoot "E:\ModelCache"`.

Runtime config:

    %LOCALAPPDATA%\JvustModel\runtime.json

Runtime logs:

    %LOCALAPPDATA%\JvustModel\logs

## Drive session security

The browser sends the current short-lived Google Drive access token to:

    http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/drive/session

The Runtime keeps it in memory only. It is not persisted in config or cache metadata.

## Download/cache behavior

GGUF models are downloaded directly through Google Drive API.

- existing complete cache → reuse immediately;
- interrupted download → resume from `.part` when Drive honors Range;
- completed file → validate GGUF header, then launch llama.cpp.

Large models still need enough local disk space for the cache. The desktop Drive app is not needed.

## 当前实际可用状态

模型登记、Drive 文件和运行适配器是三个不同状态。网页会展示登记表中的全部模型，但只有同时满足“Drive 主库有权重”和“对应运行适配器已接通”的模型才会出现启动入口。

目前已经接通网页自动运行的模型包括 Pony Diffusion V6 XL、Qwen-Image 2.1 GGUF 图像工作流、Wan2.2 TI2V 5B 和 HunyuanVideo 1.5 视频工作流，以及 Drive 中实际存在聊天 GGUF 文件时的 llama.cpp 聊天链路。OCR、Embedding、Reranker、时间序列及尚未完成依赖验证的图像模型继续只显示运行方案。

模型卡片上的“查看运行方案”只会读取本机后端和模型状态，不会把任意 .safetensors、.pth 或 .ckpt 文件假设成可以直接启动的模型。这样可以避免下载大量文件后才发现缺少 VAE、文本编码器、预处理器或工作流。

## Backend routing

Current targets:

- GGUF → llama.cpp
- image/video → ComfyUI / Diffusers
- OCR/multimodal/RAG → Transformers
- time-series → PyTorch
- ONNX → ONNX Runtime
- TFLite → TFLite

Automatic web adapters now include:

- GGUF → Drive API cache → llama.cpp → web chat.
- Pony Diffusion V6 XL → Drive API cache → managed ComfyUI SDXL workflow → web image workspace.
- Qwen-Image 2.1 GGUF → linked Drive folder → Drive API cache → managed ComfyUI + ComfyUI-GGUF → web image workspace.
- Wan2.2 TI2V 5B → managed ComfyUI → web video workspace.
- HunyuanVideo 1.5 T2V → managed ComfyUI → web video workspace.

For the video adapters, the Drive package remains the catalog/model identity, while Runtime caches the official ComfyUI-compatible backend artifacts required by the selected workflow. This is necessary because the Drive-native training/inference package layout is not identical to ComfyUI's repackaged model layout.

The managed ComfyUI image/video path currently targets NVIDIA Windows systems. Runtime checks hardware before exposing the direct-use action; unsupported machines stay on the run-plan path and do not start a large model download.

First video use may download:

- ComfyUI Windows Portable (NVIDIA cu126);
- several large model artifacts required by the official workflow.

Those files are cached under `D:\Model\video` by default and reused later. Set `MODEL_VIDEO_ROOT` to override the video cache only.

See `docs/MULTI_BACKEND.md` for the remaining family adapters.

## Image workspace

Select an adapted image model and click **使用图像模型**. Runtime validates every fixed artifact declared by that adapter, downloads/resumes only the selected Drive files into the persistent `D:\\Model` cache, prepares managed ComfyUI, submits the fixed workflow and streams the generated image back to the webpage.

Current direct image adapters:

- Pony Diffusion V6 XL — 1024×1024 default, 28 steps, CFG 5, CLIP skip 2.
- Qwen-Image 2.1 GGUF — 768×768 default, 20 steps, CFG 1.0; fixed files are `qwen-image-2.1-Q4_K_M.gguf`, `qwen3vl_8b_int8_convrot.safetensors`, and `qwen_image_2.1_vae_bf16.safetensors`.

Qwen-Image remains in its existing Drive root folder. The website links that folder into the model index at scan time instead of copying roughly 14 GB of weights into `AI-Model-Vault`. First Qwen use installs the small ComfyUI-GGUF custom node/dependencies into the managed ComfyUI runtime, then reuses them.

FLUX.2 Klein 4B FP8 remains **adapter required** until its complete companion-component/runtime path is verified; a `.safetensors` file alone is not treated as runnable.

## Hardware preflight

Runtime v0.12 checks hardware before starting large local workloads.

- managed ComfyUI: detects `nvidia-smi`, CUDA version, GPU/VRAM and cache free space;
- Pony image safety floor: 8 GB VRAM;
- Qwen-Image 2.1 GGUF safety floor: 14 GB VRAM and 18 GB free cache space;
- Wan2.2 TI2V 5B safety floor: 12 GB VRAM;
- HunyuanVideo 1.5 safety floor: 16 GB VRAM;
- managed ComfyUI keeps at least 10 GB cache free space before launch;
- GGUF launch plans report cache disk, available system memory and configured CPU threads;
- Drive downloads verify the remaining model bytes plus a 2 GB cache reserve before transfer.

If NVIDIA/CUDA is unavailable, image/video models stay on the run-plan path and the UI reports **需要远程 NVIDIA Runtime** instead of starting a large local download. These thresholds are startup safety floors, not guarantees that every resolution/step configuration will fit.

## Remote NVIDIA Runtime

Devices without a usable local NVIDIA CUDA path can point the same website at another NVIDIA Windows machine without changing model/task APIs.

On the NVIDIA host:

    runtime\Enable-Remote-Nvidia.cmd

This keeps Model Runtime bound to `127.0.0.1:8765`, exposes it privately through **Tailscale Serve** on dedicated HTTPS port `8443`, generates a random Runtime token, and restarts the local Runtime with remote authentication enabled.

On the client, open **高级诊断**, set **Runtime Bridge** to the printed `https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443` address, enter the Runtime token, and click **重新连接**.

Security properties:

- Tailscale Serve only, never Funnel;
- Runtime continues to listen on localhost only;
- tailnet ACLs remain in force;
- protected Runtime API calls require a 256-bit token;
- the browser keeps the Runtime token only in `sessionStorage`;
- non-loopback Runtime URLs must use HTTPS;
- Drive OAuth access tokens are still memory-only inside Runtime.

Disable the remote listener with:

    runtime\Disable-Remote-Nvidia.cmd

See `docs/REMOTE_NVIDIA_RUNTIME.md` for the architecture, token rotation, and validation boundary.
## Video workspace

Select an adapted video model in the model library and click **使用视频模型**.

The web workspace exposes prompt, negative prompt, resolution, frames, FPS, steps, CFG and seed. Runtime then prepares ComfyUI, queues the official workflow, tracks progress and returns the generated video directly to the browser.

Current direct video adapters:

- Wan2.2-TI2V-5B
- HunyuanVideo-1.5

Video generation is hardware-intensive; successful execution depends on available GPU/VRAM/RAM/disk and the selected settings.
